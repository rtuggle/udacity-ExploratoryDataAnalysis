Load data about deaths from storms from gapminder.
```{r data}

setwd("/Users/ryantuggle/Repositories/udacity")
require(tidyr)
require(dplyr)
require(ggplot2)
population <- read.csv("data/indicator_population.csv") %>%
    gather("year", "population", 2:92) %>%
    rename(country = Total.population) %>%
    mutate(yearInt = as.numeric(substring(year,2,5)),
           population = as.numeric(population)) %>%
    filter(yearInt >= 1970)

density <- read.csv("data/indicator_population density.csv") %>%
    gather("year", "popDensity", 2:62) %>%
    rename(country = Population.density..per.square.km.)

deaths <- read.csv("data/indicator_storm killed.csv") %>% 
    gather("year", "deaths", 2:41) %>%
    rename(country = Storm.killed) %>%
    inner_join(population, by = c("country","year")) %>%
    left_join(density, by = c("country","year")) %>%
    mutate(index.death = deaths / (population / 10000),
           decade = as.factor(paste(substring(year, 2, 4), "0s", sep = "")))
    
```


Use scatter plots to see relationship between storm deaths and population density.

```{r scatter}

ggplot(deaths %>%
           group_by(year) %>%
           summarise(sumPop = sum(population, na.rm = TRUE),
                     sumDeaths = sum(deaths, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
           mutate(index = sumDeaths / (sumPop / 100000)),
       aes(x = year, y = index)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "Identity")

ggplot(filter(deaths, index.death != 0 & popDensity <= 2000),
       aes(x = popDensity, y=index.death)) +
    geom_jitter(alpha = 0.50,
                color = "orange") +
    scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,500)) +
    geom_smooth(method = lm) +
    facet_wrap(~decade)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
